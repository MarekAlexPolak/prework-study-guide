# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for this project was preparing for the UofT fullstack development bootcamp
- This project was built in order to become acquainted with web development software before the start of the bootcamp and download all the pre-requisite software.
- This solves the problem of not having the necessary software for the bootcamp prior to class and gives the student a general intro to web development.
- I learned that building a website requires multiple different sets of code working together and the importance of github.
